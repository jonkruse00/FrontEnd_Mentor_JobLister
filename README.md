# FrontEnd_Mentor_JobLister

## Description
Project is a skills tester from the site FrontendMentor.com example project "Job Lister with Filtering"
Found Here https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/job-listings-with-filtering-ivstIPCt

## Features
- Add to filter by clicking on position or skills, tools, etc chips
- Remove from filter by clicking "X" on each chip
- Remove all from filter by clicking "CLEAR"

## BUGS to fix: 
- going to large to small the "CLEAR" Button goes out of bounds.
- material button "CLEAR" does a drop animation. Maybe change it to your CustomChip.

## TO DO
- add header (mobile and desktop) background
- add click "CLEAR" function
- add click "Remove" chip filter
- add click "Add" chip to filter
- add click "Add" position to filter
- hide/disable"CLEAR" when no filters 
- filter chips
- add tests

## Clean Up Check list
- all const used for indexing or important values are changed to CONSTANT
- alpha order imports
- indention checks
- comment on code blocks
